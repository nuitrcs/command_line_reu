# Welcome to Exercise 1! 
#
# This exercise is focused on utility commands 
#
#
# Now it is time for YOU to teach! Mwahahahaahhah!
#
# Use 'man' to find something new and interesting about one of the
# commands we've already covered, and either come up and demonstrate
# it to the group or walk me (Matthew) through it and I'll show what
# you've found.
#
# I'd like not too much overlap, so we'll go through these together
# and assign commands:
#
# cd
# ls
# top
# find
# grep
# history
# tail
# cat
# less
# head
# cp
# mv
# rm
# touch
# man
# awk
# sed
