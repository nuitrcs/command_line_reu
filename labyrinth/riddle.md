In halls of thought where questions bloom,
Beyond the bounds of lecture room,
A path exists, both wide and deep,
Where minds awaken from their sleep.

Not quite a job, yet more than class,
Where theories meet the tools of brass.
A forge of minds, both young and bright,
Who chase the truth with keen insight.

You’ll find no desks in tidy rows,
But labs where glowing data flows.
Equations dance, ideas ignite,
And failure is a welcome sight.

The mentors guide with patient hand,
Yet let you chart where you will stand.
You’re not yet master, not quite new,
But given space to think things through.

You’ll write, you’ll code, you’ll test and try,
You’ll ask the how, the what, the why.
You’ll learn that knowledge isn’t still—
It grows with curiosity and will.

It’s not for pay, nor fame, nor grade,
But for the joy of truth well made.
A summer’s quest, a scholar’s rite,
To turn the spark into a light.

So tell me now, what is this place,
Where undergrads the unknown chase?
Where learning leaps beyond the page,
And youth steps on the scholar’s stage?
